## General info
This site could be used as a general template for any ecommerce application. It uses Gatsby on the front end and Sanity on the back end to pull all the product information. Making it extremely easy for clients to add or edit items in their store. Furthermore, the site is fully integrated with stripe to securely handle payments.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React
* Graphql
* State Context
* Gatsby
* Sanity
* Bootstrap
* Stripe

## What I Learned
I think the biggest accomplishment for myself with this project was reading Gatsby, Sanity and Stripe's documentation to implement their API's. Furthermore, I took on the role of UI designer using XD to build user stories.

Overally I am really happy with the project and I feel that it went a long way towards showing my proficiencies as a well rounded web developer.
